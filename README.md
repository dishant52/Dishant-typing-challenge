Dishant Typing Test

Project Overview: Dishant Typing Test is a fun and engaging typing challenge where users have 30 seconds to type a given paragraph. The test tracks how many words you type and calculates your Words Per Minute (WPM). The goal is to type as fast and accurately as possible, and the app will show you your speed at the end.

Features: - 30-second timer: You have 30 seconds to type as much as you can from the provided paragraph. - Words Per Minute (WPM): After the timer ends, the app calculates how many words per minute you typed. - Start Timer Automatically: The timer begins when you start typing. - Simple UI: The app has a clean and user-friendly interface to focus on the typing task.

How It Works: 1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file. 2. Open the index.html file in your browser to run the app. 3. Start typing in the text area. The timer will start automatically when you begin typing. 4. Once the 30 seconds are up, the app will display: - Words Typed: How many words you typed during the test. - WPM: Your typing speed (Words Per Minute). 5. Restart the test by clicking the "Restart Test" button to try again.

Technologies Used: - HTML: Used for structuring the content of the page. - CSS: For styling and layout. - JavaScript: The logic for handling the timer, typing functionality, and calculating WPM.

Project Files: - index.html: The main HTML file that holds the structure of the page. - script.js: JavaScript file where all the logic (timer, WPM calculation) is implemented. - README: This text file with project description.
